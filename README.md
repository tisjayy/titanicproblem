🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier
This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data from Australia.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Rain in Australia

Target Variable: RainTomorrow (Yes/No)

🛠️ Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (including GridSearchCV)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

🧠 Steps
Load and clean the dataset

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Train classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV for optimized performance

Evaluate using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, precision, and recall

Predict rainfall on new data

✅ Results
